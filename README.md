# Go Projects Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering the Go programming language (Golang) through hands-on projects. Each project is designed to help reinforce core concepts and build practical skills in Go development.

## Projects

### 01 - A Simple Web Server
A basic web server built with Go that demonstrates:
- Serving static files (HTML)
- Handling GET and POST requests
- Simple form processing

**Structure:**
- `main.go`: Main application logic for the web server
- `static/index.html`: Example static file served at the root
- `static/form.html`: HTML form for submitting data to the server

**How to Run:**
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd "01 - A Simple Web Server"
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit:
   - [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) for the static page
   - [http://localhost:8080/form](http://localhost:8080/form) for the form (submit with POST)
   - [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) for a simple hello endpoint
